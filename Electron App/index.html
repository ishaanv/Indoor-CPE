          <p>This is a plotly graph that looks at a lot of data, and only takes 30 seconds worth of it. performance wise it's a monster, but that only really shows up on shim data, and hopefully won't be an issue with a rolling buffer.</p>
          <h3>TODO:</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>The left side doesn't hide the bit where the data disapears, so it's a bit odd that there's a gap.</li>
          <li>The ticks auto fill, I think I'd like subticks that are at 1s intervals. (or grid lines)</li>
          <li class="done">There's only one axis, probably should <a href="https://plot.ly/javascript/multiple-axes/#multiple-yaxes">have 3</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Thoughts?</p>
